## Our 2018 season has now concluded and this is the final code
## We placed 8th alliance overall due to mechanical issues that were unavoidable.
## To next years programming team,
#                               This code should be mostly adjustable for 
#                               whatever the game is in 2019. Text me for help
#                               or questions.

## signing off for what is *maybe* the last time, 
##                ~Grey
